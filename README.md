# 📊 Zepto SQL Data Analysis Project

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:
- Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies
- Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees
- Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue, and more
