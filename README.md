# üìä Zepto SQL Data Analysis Project

## üéØ Project Objective
The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:
- Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies
- Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees
- Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue, and more

## üìÅ Dataset Source
[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/palvinder2006/zepto-inventory-dataset/data?select=zepto_v2.csv)

## üõ†Ô∏è  Project Tasks
1.Data Exploration
- Count total records
- View sample entries
- Check for missing/null values
- List unique product categories
- Identify out-of-stock vs in-stock items
- Detect duplicate product names
2. Data Cleaning
- Remove products with MRP = 0
- Convert values from paise to rupees
- Ensure price fields are in valid format
3.Data Analysis (KPIs & Insights)
-Top 10 best-value products by discount %
- High MRP products that are out of stock
- Estimated revenue by product category
- Products with high MRP but low discounts
- Top 5 categories with highest average discounts
- Price per gram for items above 100g
- Categorization of items into Low, Medium, and Bulk
- Total inventory weight per category

## ‚úÖ Final Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be effectively used to clean, explore, and analyze a real-world e-commerce inventory dataset. By deriving insights such as top-value products, revenue-driving categories, and stock inefficiencies, the analysis supports smarter inventory management and pricing decisions.
It highlights the power of SQL in driving business intelligence through data-driven decisions in the retail and grocery domain.
